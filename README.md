# Tumor-Cancer-Detection
The tumor cancer detection model is designed to identify whether a patient has cancer or not, based on a tabular dataset that includes features such as tumor length ,width,and different medical measurements. To build the model, we experimented with several different machine learning algorithms, including SVM, KNN, naive Bayes, logistic regression, and a neural network using the TensorFlow framework.

One of the most effective algorithms we used was the neural network, which is a deep learning model that is capable of learning complex patterns in the data. We used TensorFlow, which is a powerful open-source platform for building and training neural networks.

In addition to the neural network, we also experimented with several other machine learning algorithms. SVM and KNN are both popular algorithms for classification tasks, while naive Bayes and logistic regression are well-suited for tabular data.

Overall, the tumor cancer detection model is an example of the power of machine learning algorithms for medical diagnosis, and the importance of selecting the appropriate algorithm for the given dataset. While the neural network was the most effective algorithm in our experiments, other algorithms such as SVM and KNN may be more appropriate for different datasets or use cases.
